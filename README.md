# Polyp-Cancer-Detection-System-Using-CNN
Colorectal cancer ranks second among female cancer diagnoses and third among male diagnoses. Most colorectal malignancies begin as intestinal polyps, accounting for at least 80%-95% of all cases. There has to be better ways to detect polyps in the colon early on because colon cancer is so common. The close association between colon polyp detection and colon cancer prevention makes it an effective tool for the former. The amount of polyps detected is a direct indicator of the colonoscopy's success rate. But classifying polyps is a tedious and error-prone process. This study uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models' image recognition skills and Deep Learning (DL) to help colonoscopists discover polyps during medical procedures using high-speed, real-time processing of colonoscopy pictures. Given the numerous problems with the current method, this is crucial. Colonoscopy is the most reliable screening and diagnostic tool, but the skill and dexterity of the operator are crucial to a successful procedure. The need for rapid and accurate polyp diagnosis in colonoscopy pictures is a major motivating factor for our work. Our research focuses on using deep learning to improve diagnostic accuracy in polyp diagnosis and deploying the implementation as an app that displays all the data image details upon upload. Information such as polyp size, growth detection, and polyp development stage.
# Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to create and validate a deep learning- based system for automatically detecting and delineating polyps in colonoscopy images. This involves training a specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately identify polyp boundaries across various types of colonoscopy images. Key steps include gathering a diverse dataset of colonoscopy images, applying preprocessing techniques like normalization and artifact removal, and meticulously annotating polyp regions. The system's performance will be rigorously evaluated using standard metrics to ensure its effectiveness and robustness.
Techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation will be explored to optimize the model's architecture and enhance its performance. Comparative analyses with existing methods will help demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Ultimately, integrating the trained model into user-friendly software will provide clinicians with a valuable tool for early detection and diagnosis of colorectal abnormalities during colonoscopy procedures, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of colorectal cancer screening.
